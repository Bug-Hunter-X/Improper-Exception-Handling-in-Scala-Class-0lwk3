# Improper Exception Handling in Scala

This repository demonstrates a simple Scala program that showcases improper exception handling.  The `MyClass` class includes a setter for the `age` property that throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if a negative age is attempted to be set.

The example shows how the exception is caught and handled, but more robust error handling might be needed in a production environment.
